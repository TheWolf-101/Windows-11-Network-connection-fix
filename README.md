This simple script basically, essentially, more or less disables the Credential Guard that was introduced with Windows 11 via regedit changes. This script is helpful for people whose network is still using older authentication methods or is having issues with saved credentials not transferring over to Windows 11 from Windows 10.
Keep in mind the script does use a force restart 15 seconds after making the changes.
